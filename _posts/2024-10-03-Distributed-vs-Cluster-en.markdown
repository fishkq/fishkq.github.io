There are two main system architectures we often hear about: one is the distributed system, and the other is the cluster system. Both play an important role in software engineering.

A distributed system is one that splits the overall system into different parts and distributes them across multiple machines. Its goal is to decrease the time needed for each small task.

A cluster system, on the other hand, duplicates the entire system multiple times to provide the same function. Its aim is to increase the number of tasks that can be processed in a given unit of time.
