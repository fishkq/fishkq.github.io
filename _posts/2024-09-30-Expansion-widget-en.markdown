The ExpansionTile widget allows you to expand or collapse a tile to reveal or hide its children.

This widget has many configurable attributes, two of which are title and children. Both of these attributes accept widgets, allowing you to customize them with complex widgets.

After testing, the leading and trailing widgets each take up 16 pixels, while the arrow icon takes up 40 pixels.
